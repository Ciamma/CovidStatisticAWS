# Covid Statistic AWS ![Alt text](/report/images/coronavirus.png)

Welcome to our Cloud Computing Project!!!

This repo is the project for the Cloud Computing course of the Computer Science master's program.
The project was to create a system that allows for scaling based on the requests that are executed, so we created a service that allows for covid19 monitoring, allowing users who take advantage of the service both to see the number of people sick and cured, and to be able to register (completely anonymously) as sick or cured.
We used the AWS platform (it had been requested by the professor) and the result was excellent: we were able to scale excellently and our service touched 100 requests per second, plus thanks to Elastic Beanstalk we were able to get a system that also monitors the health of the service.
